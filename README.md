- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gbaru

I am a veteran of coding with some millions of lines of code written over the last many years in the most know languages: 
fortran, cobol, assembler, PL/1, RPG, dbase, Clipper, PERL, BASH, Java, Scala, 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Identity and access Management and I have a long experince with LDAP, witha few articles written for the "international conoference on LDAP"
- my last achievement was the design of a token able to transport authorization information directly to the application, making provisioning a thing of the past.

- ðŸ“« you can reach me under gio@baruzzi.de
